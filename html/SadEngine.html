			<h1>Sad Engine</h1>
			<p>During my second year at Breda University of Applied Sciences, I was assigned to work on a custom engine with 9 other programmers. The team consisted of 4 engine, 4 
			gameplay and 2 graphics programmers. I was a assigned as a <b>Graphics Programmer</b>. The custom engine, called Such-a-Disaster, had to be multi-platform and to be built 
			for a specific game(WarFair). Although the project was doing well graphics-wise, the gameplay part was lacking which is why the engine wasn't used for the development of 
			WarFair. It needed to work on Windows and on PlayStation 4. Consequently, we were provided with the tools to make an application for PS4 but the graphics programmers 
			needed to work with two rendering APIs - we chose GNMX and DirectX12.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ul class="tasks">
				<li class="done">Implement an abstract renderer.</li>

			<h2>Abstract Renderer</h2>
			<p>With the other graphics programmer, we designed an abstract renderer which should've run on both Windows and PS4. We were not experienced with GMNX(PS4's high-level graphics API). 
			We wanted our renderer to support the low-level tools that both APIs had, so we spent more time implementing the abstract renderer. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, our lecturers 
			told us to not build the project for PS4 because we didn't have access to the PS4 toolkits. The engine still had an abstract renderer but it used only DirectX12 and half 
			implemented GNMX, so it didn't have any purpose and we didn't know if it works. It was meaningless, but we thought we didn't have enough time to redo the project without it, so we left it.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h2>Particle System</h2>
			<img src="../images/SadEngine/ParticleSystem.gif" class="feature-image"/>
			<p>Since our engine was being built for WarFair, we asked artists, assigned in WarFair, about what features they wanted to be implemented. They mentioned animations and particles as 
			the most important ones. Consequently, the other graphics programmer started working on animations and I started working on particles. In order to make it easier for artists 
			to use the engine's particle system, I created a system similar to that of Unreal Engine 4. Every particle system has an array of modules that can be dynamically assigned to it. 
			A module adds an effect on all particles in the particle system. A particle is a sprite which uses a spritesheet. I created the sprites in DX12 and by using bitwise operations in the shaders. 
			The vertex shader accepts a vertex and makes it into a quad. It also uses UV offsets combined with the lifetime of the particle to create a spritesheet animation. Finally, the particles 
			had to be Z-ordered so that they can be blended.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h2>Bloom</h2>
			<div style="display: inline-block;">
			<img src="../images/SadEngine/Bloom.gif" class="feature-image"/>
			<p>The project had very flat colors so I decided to implement a post-processing effect called Bloom. It uses Gaussian Blur and blurs the brighter pixels making a glowing 
			effect.
			</p>

			<h2>Shadows</h2>
			<div style="min-height: 300px;">
			<img src="../images/SadEngine/Shadows.png" class="feature-image"/>
			<p>I implemented omnidirectional shadows for point lights. I used 6 projection matrices for all directions around a point light. I saved 6 depth buffers and combined them into a 
			cube depth map in order to ray-sample from it in the fragment shader. This had to be implemented in DirectX12 before doing shader work. I used RenderDoc to debug the buffers used for 
			shadow mapping. Unfortunately, the cube depth map was saved with values from 0 to 1, which made the implementation far more complicated than it should've been.
			</div>
			<br/>
			<h2>Volumetric Lights</h2>
			<div style="min-height: 300px;">

			</video>
			<p>Volumetric lights can be implemented in multiple ways. I researched 2D screen space volumetric lights but the project required to see light scattering by not only looking at the light. 
			Another way is to march through rays sent from the camera and test if they are shadowed. I am experienced with this method because I've used Ray-Marching before. In order to have better 
			scattering visuals, I applied the Mie Scattering alogrithm while testing if a point in space is shadowed.
