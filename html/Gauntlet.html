			<h1>Gauntlet</h1>
			<p>After entering Breda University of Applied Sciences, my first assigned project was to recreate an old game, called 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_(1985_video_game)">Gauntlet</a>, in 6 weeks. I was provided with a C++ framework which had an implemented game loop 
			and a 2D renderer using OpenGL. At that point, I had no idea how to create a project which used proper CPU/GPU synchronization and delta time. I was mostly 
			experimenting by using the functions provided with the framework.</p>
			<br/>
			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ul class="tasks">
				<li class="done">Create a grid that can use a text file to define where walls and enemy spawners will be.</li>
				<li class="done">Make player movement and shooting with calculated 'grid collision'.</li>
				<li class="done">Make melee and ranged enemies.</li>
				<li class="canceled">Add enemy ranged attacks over walls.</li>
				<li class="canceled">Make enemies use A* pathfinding.</li>
				<li class="done">Add food, treasures, keys, and doors.</li>
				<li class="done">Make copies of the first 10 original levels.</li>
				<li class="done">Add Menu and UI for the game.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Even though I was very unexperienced, I managed to add most of the features in just 6 weeks time. The code is disastrous. There is no following 
			of programming standards, and I believe no one can read it at this point. I didn't make ranged attacks over the walls since I didn't realize that the 
			game has such a feature. I also didn't implement pathfinding since I didn't believe I could have achieved such an algorithm with the level of skills 
			I had. The project wasn't loading the map and the enemies correctly, but I noticed that a week after my assignment had ended. I used multithreading 
			to create a loading screen and cover the incorrect map loading, and I did the same for the enemies spawning. The maps are created literally from my own text files 
			since I was too afraid to read from any different extension for 2D grid maps.

			<p>The following video shows how the game looked in the end. Only the first two levels had enemy spawners in them and I just added the maps for the other levels. 
			I also added more features like exploding potions which killed all the enemies currently on the screen.</p>
