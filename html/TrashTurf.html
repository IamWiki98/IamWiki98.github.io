			<p>This game was my fourth project at Breda University of Applied Sciences. I was assigned in Team 18 which consisted of 9 people. The team had 1 producer, 2 designers,
			3 artists, and 3 programmers(me included). Three people of the team had designed the idea for the game before we were all assigned to it. I wasn't one of them so 
			I joined later and we had 6 weeks to make a game using Unreal Engine 4. I worked on the Camera, Physics, Visual Effects, and UI since I found them to be the most important.

			<h2>Camera</h2>
			<img src="../images/TrashTurf/CameraMovement.gif" class="feature-image" />
			<p>After I joined Team 18, I didn't know what to work on but I saw the camera as an important asset to the game. Consequently, I directly 
			assigned myself to implement it. After experimenting with it, I relized that the game should be focused on the middle of the map and on the players at the 
			same time. I figured I should make my own algorithm which tracks the players' location compared to the map's center location, and from there move the camera 
			to a calculated location considering how close the players are to each other.

			<h2>Physics</h2>
			<img src="../images/TrashTurf/RaccoonSwinging.gif" class="feature-image"/>
			<p>After making raccoons being able to hit each other, the lecturers advised us to implement physics in the game. I have studied physics in high school so I immediately 
			got interested and knew how to make the game feel with much better mechanics. I took centrifugal force into consideration since the game is literally raccoons swinging 
			trash bags around themselves. I didn't research how centrifugal force works but instead created my own way of managing it. The physics I created received great compliments 
			from our teachers. I then introduced raccoon strength and implemented the ability to swing the trash bag but using the force it already has applied to it. This means the 
			raccoon can't quickly swing the bag just by standing still.

			<h2>Visual Effects</h2>
			<img src="../images/TrashTurf/RaccoonExplosion.gif" class="feature-image"/>
			<p>I helped the artists make the environnment feel more alive. I implemented looping clouds in the background. I made objects in front of the scene which move in respect of 
			the camera so the players can feel as if they are in the scene. The artists wanted all the models to be paper-like. Consequently, I made the characters rotate as if they are 
			made of paper. Unfortunately, the lecturers didn't like the idea so I removed it. Finally, I made an explosion effect when a raccoon goes out of the screen(dies).
			</p>

			</div>
			<h2>UI</h2>
			<div style="display: inline-block;">
			<img src="../images/TrashTurf/UI.gif" align="right" class="feature-image"/>
			<p>I managed to create the whole menu in one night(I wasn't assigned for it) since an artist pushed me to do it before the game presentation. I was inexperienced with it 
			but I achieved what is shown on the GIF. The different models are buttons.

			<p>This was the most enjoyable project to work on. Also, it was my best one when it comes to gameplay. Breda University has events for rewarding different games and 
			Trash Turf was nominated 4 times which no other game could brag about. Unfortunately, we didn't win any of the nominations but we definitely had an amazing game. Trash Turf 
			was built in just 6 weeks time and we were with the smallest team. But yet again, the code is disastrous since we weren't that experienced.
